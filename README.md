## Development Notes

- **Obstacles faced during the development**:
    1. A common mistake was forgetting to call the draw function, leading to the illusion that the code didn't work.
    2. The Canvas API needed close attention to detail.

- The game utilizes the Canvas API for rendering. For those keen on expanding or understanding the code, refer to the [Canvas API documentation on MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Canvas_API).
